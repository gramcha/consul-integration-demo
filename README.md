# consul-integration-demo
A simple implementation of integrating springboot application with consul.

### What is consul?
It is a tool for discovering and configuring services in your infrastructure. It provides several key features:
##### Service Discovery: 
Clients of Consul can provide a service, such as api or mysql, and other clients can use Consul to discover providers of a given service. Using either DNS or HTTP, applications can easily find the services they depend upon.

##### Health Checking: 
Consul clients can provide any number of health checks, either associated with a given service ("is the webserver returning 200 OK"), or with the local node ("is memory utilization below 90%"). This information can be used by an operator to monitor cluster health, and it is used by the service discovery components to route traffic away from unhealthy hosts.

##### KV Store: 
Applications can make use of Consul's hierarchical key/value store for any number of purposes, including dynamic configuration, feature flagging, coordination, leader election, and more. The simple HTTP API makes it easy to use.

#### Prerequisites
Itâ€™s recommended to take a quick look at Consul and all its features. Install consul and run it in your machine.

For simplicity run the consul agent in deve mode.
**command**

    consul agent -dev

Please verify the consul status by opening browser with http://localhost:8500/

###### Step 1
Download springboot project from spring initializr. 
###### Step 2
Add the spring-cloud-starter-consul-all dependency to pom.xml
*pom.xml*

    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-consul-all</artifactId>
        <version>1.3.0.RELEASE</version>
    </dependency>
###### Step 3
*execute*

    mvn spring-boot:run
    
By default, Spring Boot will try to connect to the Consul agent at localhost:8500. For me I faced runtime error **"Consul service ids must not be empty, must start with a letter, end with a letter or digit, and have as interior characters only letters, digits, and hyphen"**. To resolve this error add the application name to **application.yml** file.
###### Step 4
*update application.yml*

    spring:
        application:
            name: consul-integration-demo
        cloud:
            consul:
                host: localhost
                port: 8500
    
Consul rejection error resolved once application name added to the **application.yml** file. Run the application and check the consul ui(http://localhost:8500/). We can see the **consul-integration-demo** in services tab in consul.

It means our service discovery part is okay.

#### Finding services using Consul
We already have our application registered in Consul, but how can clients find the service endpoints? We need a discovery client service to get a running and available service from Consul. Spring provides a *DiscoveryClient* API for this, which we can enable with the **@EnableDiscoveryClient** annotation:

*update application class with **@EnableDiscoveryClient***

    @SpringBootApplication
    @EnableDiscoveryClient
    @ComponentScan(basePackages= {"com.gramcha.*"})
    public class ConsulIntegrationDemoApplication {
    	public static void main(String[] args) {
    		SpringApplication.run(ConsulIntegrationDemoApplication.class, args);
    	}
    }

We are going to discover our service through consul in our service itself. This is to simulate finding URL of some service using consul. Let's create RestController class with two URL mappings "/discoveryClient","/ping".

In *"/discoveryClient"* mapping we are going to query the consul with application name **"consul-integration-demo"** and adding *"/ping"* to the URL returned by consul and make REST GET call.

Inject the DiscoveryClient bean into our restcontroller class to make query to consul.
*restcontroller and discoveryclient bean*

    @RestController
    public class DiscoveryClientController {
    	@Autowired
        private DiscoveryClient discoveryClient;
     
        public Optional<URI> serviceUrl() {
            return discoveryClient.getInstances("consul-integration-demo")
              .stream()
              .map(si -> si.getUri())
              .findFirst();
        }
    }

*discoveryClient.getInstances("consul-integration-demo")* will return list of URL with port number. For example: http://10.40.100.44:8080
